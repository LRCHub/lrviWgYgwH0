Collapsed empires like broken tiles
Snow on the ground, a winters sky
I, I open the door and the world flows by
Pavements, streets and yesterdays news
Tomorrows hurting in todays blues
I, my realities are these tender rules Every high and low
Every near and far
Goodbye, Hello
Everybody
Come together
Come together
Come together now
Put your loneliness in mine and RISE No major headlines, no big news day
Just the wheels turning forwards and backwards
And backwards and forwards
Day after day, as the blue skies fade Every high and low
Every near and far
Goodbye, Hello
Everybody
Come together
Come together
Come together now
Put your loneliness in mine and RISE Put your arms around me
Everything's alright
You and ITogether we will RISE Come together
Come together
Come together now
Put your loneliness in mine and RISECome together
Come together
Come together now
Put your loneliness in mine and RISE
